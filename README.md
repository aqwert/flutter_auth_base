# flutter_auth_base 

A flutter package that provides a base level set of classes to implement authentication controls

# Usage

On its own this package does not do anything, but it is required as a dependency for other authentication packages. Currently the packages supported are:

 > [flutter_auth_firebase](https://github.com/aqwert/flutter_auth_firebase)


In adition to the dependency that package has on this one, the [flutter_auth_starter](https://github.com/aqwert/flutter_auth_starter) also requires it providing a [mocked implementation](https://github.com/aqwert/flutter_auth_starter/tree/master/lib/core/auth/mock)


## Implementation

This is completely optional, only if you want to get your hands dirty in implementing a custom authentication provider. It does require providing implementation of all the [abstract files](https://github.com/aqwert/flutter_auth_base/tree/master/lib/src)
